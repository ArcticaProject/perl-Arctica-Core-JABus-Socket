Description: JABus Server/Client implementation for Arctica Framework
 The Arctica Project brings forth a remote computing framework of
 enterprise grade and quality. The Arctica Framework is a highly
 modularized and thus pluggable for developing alls sort of remote
 services.
 .
 The Arctica::Core::JABus::Socket module provides an API to Arctica
 modules and service that allow easy set up of all sorts of server-
 client connections. JABus is event centric, so you can tie hooks
 to special events happening on the data connection.
